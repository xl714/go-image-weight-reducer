# go image weight reducer

Execute the following command to run the code:

```

go mod init github.com/xl714/go-image-weight-reducer
go mod tidy


go run main.go
```

Formatting: For better readability, use the go fmt command to automatically format your code:

```
go fmt main.go
```

Building a Binary: To create a standalone executable file, use the go build command:

```
go build -o GoImageWeightReducerExe main.go
```

This will create an executable file named hello in your project directory. You can run it directly without the go run command.

Using Modules: For larger projects, consider using Go modules for dependency management.
